Perl script to generate Pokemon teams when supplied with a list to choose
from.

  Currently will only generate random teams. Possibly more functionality later.

  The list should be numbered from 0 to n, a pokemon name on each line
following the number and using a colon as a separator.

  Since I'm bad at explaining, here's an example:

    0:<name>
    1:<name>
    .
    .
    .
    n:<name>
